# Object Oriented Programming in Java

Here's a brief description of each project:

- Kevin Bacon -> This game implements the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon or Bacon's law. If you're unfamiliar with this game it asks players to name any actor/actress and within 6 moves they can somehow relate that person to Kevin Bacon, due to the large number of movies that Kevin Bacon has been in. In terms of how it's implemented, it uses breadth first search on a graph to find the shortest path to Kevin Bacon. 

- Polymorphic Tree -> This was primarily for learning purposes in order to familiarize myself with BSTs

- Recursion -> This also served primarily for learning purposes to familiarize myself with the concept of recursion on more difficult problems

- Tetris -> A working Tetris game in Java with a functioning GUI

- Word Frequency -> Uses a linked list to get the frequency of a word in a large text file
