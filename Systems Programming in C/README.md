# Systems Programming Projects

Here's a general description of each project

- Dynamically Allocated Priority Queue -> This project implements a dynamically allocated Priority Queue in ISO C90. The main purpose of this project was to get used to the concept of dynamic memory allocated on a larger data structure such as a priority queue. 

- Good Programming Style Checker -> The purpose of this project was to create a program that reads a file and checks which lines are over 80 characters and which ones violate the ISO C90 style guide. I used this program quite frequently after creating it on my other C programs to check if I was following the language's style guide. This project also demonstrates some of my knowledge in file reading in C. 

-  Mathlon -> Implements a hypothetical CPU named mathlon that reads a 32-bit n2 instruction and outputs human readable assembly code. 

- Translating C to MIPS 2000 Assembly -> Translates 3 C programs to MIPS 2000 Assembly.
